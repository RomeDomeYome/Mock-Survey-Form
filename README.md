# Mock-Survey-Form
A survey based off a freecodecamp project

Project was made to look like the example given by freecodecamp: https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks
I had to fulfill the requirements given here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-survey-form-project/build-a-survey-form

To be clear, I didnt copy the html and css. I figured it out on my own. I would occasionally inspect element the given design if I got stuck.

The survey doesnt submit anything to me, so feel free to fill it out for fun.
